Topics
------

*   Bargaining on Networks
*   Contagion Models
*   Mean-Field Approximation

Recall
------

*   Take-it-or-leave-it offer:
    *   One party makes an offer.  
        Then, the other party accepts or rejects it.  
        Game end.
    *   The proposer takes all the surplus.¬†
*   Rubinstein's bargaining:
    *   One party makes an offer.  
        The other party accepts or rejects.  
        If rejected, he makes a counter offer.  
        Continue until a party accepts.
    *   The first proposer takes _1/(1 + Œ¥)_. The offeree takes _Œ¥/(1 + Œ¥)_.

Bargaining on Networks
----------------------

What if there are two sellers?

*   Take-it-or-leave-it offer:  
    *   If _S1_ offers _p_, _S2_ has incentive to offer _p ‚Äî Œµ_.
    *   Even if sellers make (simultaneous) offers, they receive 0. The buyer receives 1.
*   Rubinstein's bargaining:
    *   If _S__1_ offers _1/(1 + Œ¥)_,¬†_S__2_ has incentive to offer _1/(1 + Œ¥) ‚Äî Œµ_.
    *   Again, the sellers receive 0, the buyer takes it all.¬†

Contagion Models
----------------

Recall games with externalities

*   _N_ = \[0, 1\]
*   _Si_ = {Adopt, Not Adopt}
*     
    ![Games with externalities equation.](/coursemedia/14-15j-networks-spring-2018/4a315788e2ae30aee7e776502c0e6ccc_MIT14_15JS18_rec12d.png)  
    Where _X_ is the share of adoption.¬†

This has externalities, but network structure doesn't matter. In reality, you may register for Instagram not only because it is popular, but also because your friends have it.¬†

Consider undirected graph (_V_, _E_), _N_(_i_)¬†‚äÇ _V_  
Where _V_ are vertices, _E_ are edges, and _N_ is the set of neighbors of vertex _i_¬†‚àà _V_.

*   _N_ = _V_
*   _Si_ = {Adopt, Not Adopt} = {1, 0}.
*

### _Example_

![Diagram of connected vertices](/coursemedia/14-15j-networks-spring-2018/730cf58198bc35247301325c83d4c238_MIT14_15JS18_rec12b.png)

*   Too complicated to solve (many-body problem).
*   Nor do we care about particular solution on particular networks. Often concerned with particular degree distribution, but not finer details.
*   Mean-field approximation to solve for stationary equation.¬†

To solve:

1.  Consider random graph with the degree distribution and fix some neighbor adoption probability _X_.¬†
2.  Obtain best response strategy given _X_ and compute adoption share _XÃÇ_.
3.  Derive fixed point.¬†

### _Example_

Let _N_ = _V_ = \[0, 1\] and¬†

¬†![Graph equation](/coursemedia/14-15j-networks-spring-2018/bb8b417c87219fb78a792637521a92c1_MIT14_15JS18_rec12c.png)

*   Agents are heterogeneous _ci_ ~ _F_(0, 1).
*   Degree distribution _d__i_ ~ _D_.

To solve:

1.  Fix some _X_. Pick agent _i_ randomly.
2.  _i_ with _c__i_ and _d__i_ would adopt if

3.  Since _ci_ ~ _F_\[0, 1\], the probability that a random person with degree _d__i_ (but unknown _c__i_) adopts is _F_(_V_(_d__i_, _X_)). Since _d__i_ ~ _D_, we have the share of adoption ùîºD\[_F_(_V_(_d__i_,¬†_X_))\] . From here, we can compute the neighbor adoption share _XÃÇ_.
